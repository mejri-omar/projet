        <h1>Minesweeper Instructions</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Minesweeper game! Hereâ€™s how to play:</p>
        
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>Your goal is to clear a grid containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them. You can reveal squares in the grid and use the numbers revealed to deduce the locations of the mines.</p>

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Starting the Game:</strong> Click on any square to begin. The game will reveal that square and the surrounding squares.</li>
            <li><strong>Understanding the Numbers:</strong> Each number represents the count of mines in the adjacent squares (including diagonals).</li>
            <li><strong>Clearing Squares:</strong> Click on squares to reveal them. If you reveal a mine, the game is over!</li>
            <li><strong>Flagging Mines:</strong> Right-click (or long-press on mobile) to flag a suspected mine. This helps you keep track of where you think the mines are.</li>
            <li><strong>Winning the Game:</strong> You win by revealing all squares that do not contain mines.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Start by clicking on the corners or edges of the grid to reveal larger areas.</li>
            <li>Use logic to deduce where mines are based on the numbers you see.</li>
            <li>Don't rush! Take your time to think through your moves.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Good Luck!</h2>
        <p>Have fun playing Minesweeper! May your clicks be safe!</p>
